<h2>Energy preserving methods for differential equations</h2>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
    This page summarises the new energy-preserving method proposed in <a
    href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/21M1442644">this paper</a> (or the
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.06548.pdf">open access version</a>)
    called the <b>multiple quadratic auxiliary method</b>. The numerical method
    is designed to solve any differential equation with one (or more) polynomial
    invariant whilst preserving that invariant exactly.
    It does so by the following:
    <ul style="font-family: Arial">
        <li>introduces auxiliary variables to reformulate the equation in a
            higher-dimensional space with modified quadratic invariants/energy,</li>
        <li>performs the numerical integration in the higher-dimensional space
        whilst preserving all the modified quadratic invariants/energy,</li>
        <li>projects exactly back onto the original space yielding a method that preserves
        the original invariants.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
    The method is cool because:
    <ul style="font-family: Arial">
        <li>it is surprisingly simple (relative to other geometric methods),</li>
        <li>it is a new type of <em>discrete gradient,
        method</em></li>
        <li>It generalises the <em>averaged vector field method</em> for polynomial Hamiltonians.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
    The rest of this page gives an example of the method applied to a simple 2-D
    mass-spring differential equation with a quartic potential (quartic
    oscillator).
</p>

<h2>The quartic oscillator</h2>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
    Say that we have a unit mass $(m=1)$ on a spring with whose force is
    proportional to the cube of its displacement $F=kx_2^3$. This would mean
    that the total energy is $$E=\frac{1}{2}x_1^2+\frac{1}{4}x_2^4,$$ where we
    have set $k=1$ and $x_1=\dot{x}_2$ is the velocity. This results in the
    following set of differential equations (Newton's second law of motion)
    $$\dot{x}_1=-x_2^3,\quad\dot{x}_2=x_1.$$ We want to create a numerical
    approximation to the solution of this differential equation. However, we
    know that the total energy is preserved along this solution ($\dot{E}(x_1,
    x_2)=0$) so let's also create a geometric numerical method that is also
    energy-preserving. 
</p>
<h2>The implicit midpoint method (not energy-preserving)</h2>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
    Given a differential equation in vector notation
    $\dot{\mathbf{x}}=\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})$ then the implicit midpoint method
    is the given by the following $$\frac{\mathbf{x}'-\mathbf{x}}{h} =
    \mathbf{f}\left(\frac{\mathbf{x}'+\mathbf{x}}{2}\right),$$ where $h<< 1$ is
    a small finite time step, $\mathbf{x}'\approx\mathbf{x}(h)$ is the numerical
    approximation to the exact solution of the differential equation at time $h$
    starting from initial conditions $\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{x}(0)$. Solving this
    set of equations for the the vector $\mathbf{x}'$ gives the midpoint method.
    Let's apply the implicit midpoint method to the quartic oscillator. This
    yields the following algebraic equations $$\begin{align}\frac{x_1'-x_1}{h} =&
    -\left(\frac{x_2'+x_2}{2}\right)^3,\\ \frac{x_2'-x_2}{h} =&
    \frac{x_1'+x_1}{2}.\end{align}$$ Solving the above for $x_1'$ and $x_2'$ gives the the
    midpoint method solution to the quartic oscillator at time $h$. However we
    will find that this solution is not energy preserving, meaning
    $E(x_1',x_2')\ne E(x_1,x_2)$. 
    <br><br>
    However, the interesting thing about the midpoint method is that if it is
    applied to a differential equation with degree 2 (quadratic) polynomial
    invariants, then the midpoint rule preserves those invariants, that is:
    $E_{\mathrm{quadratic}}(x_1',x_2') = E_{\mathrm{quadratic}}(x_1,x_2)$. This
    can be proved mathematically. However, our energy is degree 4 (quartic) and
    hence the midpoint-rule is unable to preserve this invariant... If only the
    energy was quadratic! 
    <br><br>
</p>

<h2>Solving the quartic oscillator using quadratic auxiliary variables
(energy-preserving!) </h2>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
The whole idea behind this method is to introduce an auxiliary variable
$y_{2,2}$ to convert the quartic energy into a <em>quadratic</em> one, then
apply the midpoint rule to yield an energy preserving method on this higher
dimensional space. Let's define the new variable $$y_{2,2}=x_2^2.$$ Then we can
write our energy as $$E(x_1,x_2,y_{2,2})=\frac{1}{2}x_1^2 + \frac{1}{4}
y_{2,2}^2, $$ which is now a quadratic energy in the new variables $(x_1, x_2,
y_{2,2})$. The time derivative of $y_{2,2}$ is given by the chain rule
$\dot{y}_{2,2} = 2x_2\dot{x}_2 =2x_2x_1$. Knowing this, we can now reformulate
the original differential equation as an equivalent set of now three
differential equations $$\begin{aligned}\label{h1} \dot{x}_1 = & -x_2y_{2,2},\\
\dot{x}_2 = & x_1,\\ \dot{y}_{2,2} = & 2x_1x_2.\\ \end{aligned}$$ What we have
done is reformulated the original differential equation, which was two
dimensional with one quartic invariant, into one that is three dimensional with
two <em>quadratic invariants</em> (the second invariant being
$H(x_2,y_{2,2})=y_{2,2}-x_2^2$, this is just saying that $y_{2,2}(t)=x_2(t)^2$
for all time $t$). So to get an energy-preserving method, we just have to apply
the midpoint rule. This gives $$\begin{aligned}\label{mp1} \frac{x_1'-x_1}{h} =
& -\left(\frac{x_2'+x_2}{2}\right)\left(\frac{y_{2,2}'+y_{2,2}}{2}\right),\\
\frac{x_2'-x_2}{h} = & \left(\frac{x_1'+x_1}{2}\right),\\
\frac{y_{2,2}'-y_{2,2}}{h} = &
2\left(\frac{x_1'+x_1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{x_2'+x_2}{2}\right). \end{aligned}$$
To get the numerical solution we need to solve this set of equations for $x_1'$,
$x_2'$ <em>and</em> $y_{2,2}'$. It may be a bit unsettling that we now have to
solve a higher dimensional set of implicit equations, however due to the
midpoint rule satisfying $H(x_2,y_{2,2})=H(x_2',y_{2,2}')$ this implies that
$y_{2,2}-x_2^2=y'_{2,2}-x_2'^2$ or simply $y_{2,2}'=x_2'^2$ because our initial
conditions satisfy $y_{2,2}=x_2^2$. So we can substitute this back into the
above set of algebraic equations to get a midpoint-like method on the original
space: $$\begin{aligned}\label{1rdmp1} \frac{x_1'-x_1}{h} = &
-\left(\frac{x_2'+x_2}{2}\right)\left(\frac{x_2'^2+x_2^2}{2}\right),\\
\frac{x_2'-x_2}{h} = & \left(\frac{x_1'+x_1}{2}\right). \end{aligned}$$ More
importantly, by using this substitution we can show that $x_1'$ and $x_2'$
preserve the quartic energy $$\frac{1}{2}{x_1'}^2 + \frac{1}{4} {x'}_{2}^4=\frac{1}{2}{x_1}^2 + \frac{1}{4}
{x}_{2}^4.$$
This is shown in the following figure.

<p style="font-family: Arial">
We'll now summarise what has happened and visualise each step using the figure:
</p>
<ul style="font-family: Arial">
    <li>We start with a 2D differential equation (i.e., whose solution exists in the $x_1$-$x_2$ plane)</li>
    <li>We know that the solution has a quartic invariant (that is, the solution
    should follow the quartic contour lines of $E$, drawn as thin lines in the
    $x_1$-$x_2$ plane)</li>
    <li>Instead of solving the equation in the $x_1$-$x_2$ plane (the
    conventional approach), we introduce a third dimension, given by the
    $y_{2,2}$ axis.</li>
    <li>Now instead of a quartic contour line that we have to follow in the
    $x_1$-$x_2$ plane, we now have two quadratic hyper surfaces that our
    solution needs to lie on the intersection of. These two surfaces
    correspond to $H(x_2, y_{2,2})$ and $E(x_1, x_2, y_{2,2})$.</li>
    <li>This is easily achieved due to the fact that the midpoint method
    preserves all quadratic invariants. The solution of the midpoint method in
    the higher-dimensional space is depicted as a thick black line</li>
    <li>We can now make the substitution $y_{2,2}' = {x_2'}^2$ to project the
    solution back onto the $x_1$-$x_2$ plane. This projection is given by the
    dashed line. </li>
    <li>The method that generates this dashed line is called the multiple
    quadratic auxiliary method and it preserves the quartic energy. That is to
    say that the dashed line lies on one of the thin black contour line of
    $E(x_1,x_2)$.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Multiple invariants</h2>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
The multiple quadratic variable method can solve differntial equations and
preserve multiple invariants simultaneously! The below figures are of a 3D Nambu
system in the variables $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ with two invariants of degree 4 and 8.
On the left is the multiple quadratic auxiliary method, which stays on the
intersection of the two invariants surfaces (good!) and on the right is a higher
order Runge-Kutta method, which drifts off the surfaces (bad!). </p>

<!-- 
<p style="font-family: Arial">
    Many differential equations possess a conserved quantity such those due to
    the conservation of energy or momentum, or an invariant manifold. Given a
    differential equation $$\dot{\mathbf{x}}=\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})$$ Let's say
    that this differential equation has a conserved quantity $H(\mathbf{x})$,
    then for it to be a conserved along the solution of the differential
    equation $$\frac{\mathrm{d} H(\mathbf{x})}{\mathrm{d}
    t}=\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})^T \nabla H = 0$$ due to the chain rule. We can see
    that if we can write the differential equation as the product of a skew
    symmetric matrix $S(\mathbf{x})=-S(\mathbf{x})^T$ and the gradient of the
    invariant then the above equation is satisfied. That is
    $$\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}) = S(\mathbf{x})\nabla H(\mathbf{x})$$ then the
    solution of the differential equation keeps $H$ constant. 
    <br><br> 
    There are many existing numerical methods that solve such a differential
    equation while preserving $H(\mathbf{x})$. That is, there exist numerical
    approximations $\mathbf{x}_1\approx\mathbf{x}(\Delta t)$ that satisfy
    $H(\mathbf{x}_1)=H(\mathbf{x}_0)$. <br><br>
    What we will propose here is a new numerical method for solving differential
    equations while preserving polynomial invariants. Let's first review some
    common knowledge about Runge-Kutta methods. We know that if a differential
    equation possesses multiple invariants $H(\mathbf{x})$ that are at most
    linear, then any Runge-Kutta method will preserve these invariants. If the
    differential equation possesses multiple invariants $H(\mathbf{x})$ that are
    <em>quadratic</em>, then there are <em>certain</em> Runge-Kutta methods that
    can preserve them. For example, the midpoint rule is one such numerical
    method that preserves all such quadratic invariants. However, if we are
    given a differential equation with a polynomial invariant (with degree
    higher than 2) then there are very few methods that can preserve these
    invariants. Here we will propose a new numerical method for preserving
    polynomial invariants. <br><br>
    The idea is very simple. Given a differential equation with a cubic or
    higher invariant then we can rewrite this invariant as a quadratic invariant
    using auxiliary variables
