    Many differential equations possess a conserved quantity such those due to
    the conservation of energy or momentum, or an invariant manifold. Given a
    differential equation $$\dot{\mathbf{x}}=\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})$$ Let's say
    that this differential equation has a conserved quantity $H(\mathbf{x})$,
    then for it to be a conserved along the solution of the differential
    equation $$\frac{\mathrm{d} H(\mathbf{x})}{\mathrm{d}
    t}=\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})^T \nabla H = 0$$ due to the chain rule. We can see
    that if we can write the differential equation as the product of a skew
    symmetric matrix $S(\mathbf{x})=-S(\mathbf{x})^T$ and the gradient of the
    invariant then the above equation is satisfied. That is
    $$\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}) = S(\mathbf{x})\nabla H(\mathbf{x})$$ then the
    solution of the differential equation keeps $H$ constant. 
    <br><br> 
    There are many existing numerical methods that solve such a differential
    equation while preserving $H(\mathbf{x})$. That is, there exist numerical
    approximations $\mathbf{x}_1\approx\mathbf{x}(\Delta t)$ that satisfy
    $H(\mathbf{x}_1)=H(\mathbf{x}_0)$. <br><br>
    What we will propose here is a new numerical method for solving differential
    equations while preserving polynomial invariants. Let's first review some
    common knowledge about Runge-Kutta methods. We know that if a differential
    equation possesses multiple invariants $H(\mathbf{x})$ that are at most
    linear, then any Runge-Kutta method will preserve these invariants. If the
    differential equation possesses multiple invariants $H(\mathbf{x})$ that are
    <em>quadratic</em>, then there are <em>certain</em> Runge-Kutta methods that
    can preserve them. For example, the midpoint rule is one such numerical
    method that preserves all such quadratic invariants. However, if we are
    given a differential equation with a polynomial invariant (with degree
    higher than 2) then there are very few methods that can preserve these
    invariants. Here we will propose a new numerical method for preserving
    polynomial invariants. <br><br>
    The idea is very simple. Given a differential equation with a cubic or
    higher invariant then we can rewrite this invariant as a quadratic invariant
    using auxiliary variables
