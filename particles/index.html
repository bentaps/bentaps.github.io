Scientists and engineers study the collective behaviour of particles immersed in
turbulent fluid flows. While accurately predicting the trajectories of a single
particle is not of interest, predicting meaningful statistics from suspensions
of tens of thousands of particles is far more useful, such as when and where
particles will cluster given the fluid field. There have been many theoretical
endeavours to predict such clustering phenomena, and these are all based on a
physical conservation laws, such as the conservation of mass in the fluid field.
One such clustering phenomena is called the centrifuge effect. This is the
tendency for particles that are denser that the fluid to be spun outward when
the fluid is rotating. Conversely, lighter particles will concentrate in the
centre of a fluid vortex. The centrifuge effect is derived with the assumption
that the surrounding fluid field obeys the law of conservation of mass (i.e., it
has zero divergence). The issue is that this assumption is broken when
conventional numerical methods are used to simulate particles meaning that the
main phenomena responsible for particle clustering is overshadowed by numerical
errors. In other words, instead of particles clustering where the laws of
physics tell them to, they instead cluster where the numerical errors are
located.  One of the ideas in this study is therefore to keep this mass
conservation law true (as well as other properties of the equations) throughout
the numerical simulation in the hope that it will derive more physically
meaningful results. Recall that conventional numerical methods that are often
used in these simulations are designed to reduced the error of each individual
particle. While that is not a bad thing in and of itself, this is not really
addressing the problem we trying to solve. We want to reproduce the correct
clustering of particles and therefore need to reproduce the physical mechanisms
responsible for this.  To this end, the method that we propose is specially
designed to replicate several physical properties of the equations of motion for
the particle suspension. In particular it: (1) preserves the mass conservation
law of the fluid field; (2) reproduces the centrifuge effect in the same way the
exact solution dictates; and (3) preserves the exact dissipation of the volume
in the solution space. If you would like to read more, take a look at the main
paper.
