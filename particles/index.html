Scientists and engineers study the collective behaviour of particles immersed in
turbulent fluid flows. While accurately predicting the trajectories of a single
particle is not of interest, predicting meaningful statistics from suspensions
of thousands or millions of particles is far more useful, such as when and where
particles will cluster given the fluid field. Such applications include, for
example, tracking microplastics or tiny particles in the ocean such as plankton,
predicting ice cloud dynamics or the spread of pollutants in the atmosphere or
even simulating the spread of waterdroplets in ventilation systems.

There have been numerous theoretical endeavours to predict such clustering
phenomena, and these are all based on a physical laws, such as the
conservation of mass in the fluid field. One such clustering phenomena is called
the <em>centrifuge effect</em>. This is the tendency for particles that are denser that
the fluid to be spun outward when the fluid is rotating. Conversely, lighter
particles will concentrate in the centre of a fluid vortex.

The centrifuge effect is derived with the assumption that the surrounding fluid field obeys the
law of conservation of mass (i.e., it has zero divergence). The issue is that
this assumption is broken when conventional numerical methods are used to
simulate particles meaning that the main phenomena responsible for particle
clustering is overshadowed by numerical errors. In other words, instead of
particles clustering where the laws of physics tell them to, they instead
cluster based on the simulation errors. One of the ideas in this study is
therefore to keep this mass conservation law true (as well as other properties
of the equations) throughout the numerical simulation in the hope that it will
derive more physically meaningful results.

Recall that conventional numerical methods that are often used in these
simulations are designed to reduced the error of each individual particle. While
that is not a bad thing in and of itself, this is not really addressing the
problem we trying to solve. We want to reproduce the correct clustering of
particles and therefore need to reproduce the physical mechanisms responsible
for this.  To this end, the method that we propose is specially designed to
replicate several physical properties of the equations of motion for the
particle suspension. In particular it: (1) preserves the mass conservation law
of the fluid field; (2) reproduces the centrifuge effect in the same way the
exact solution dictates; and (3) preserves the exact dissipation of the volume
in the solution space. If you would like to read more, take a look at the main
paper.
