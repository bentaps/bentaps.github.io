        <b>Differential equations: </b>Say we have a 2-dimensional set of
        ordinary differential equations for the dependent variables $x(t)$ and
        $y(t)$ $$\dot{x}=f(x, y),\quad \dot{y}= g(x, y),$$ where the dot denotes
        a time derivative $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}$ and $x=x(t)$ and
        $y=y(t)$ are functions of $t$ but we just write $x$ and $y$ for brevity
        as we will do throughout. We often write this in the following
        <em>vector notation</em>: $$\dot{\mathbf{x}}=\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}(t)),$$
        where $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}(t))=(f(x,y),g(x,y))^T$ is called the
        <em>vector field</em> of the differential equation and
        $\mathbf{x}(t)=(x,y)^T$ is the vector of independent variables. (Note we
        write vectors with the transpose operator $^T$ as it is convention that
        vectors are column-vectors). The goal of solving differential equations
        is therefore to solve for the dependent variables $\mathbf{x}$ given the
        above differential equation and some initial data.

        Most real-world differential equations are not so easily solvable and
        can be highly non-linear and high dimensional. This means we cannot find
        an exact, general solution. However, just because we are not intelligent
        enough to find this solution, doesn't mean that one doesn't exist. As
        long as the solution exists then by using <em>numerical methods</em> we
        can approximate it to an arbitrarily high level of accuracy.
        <br><br>
        The idea behind numerical methods is as follows. Using the initial
        conditions at $\mathbf{x}(0)$ at time $t=0$ and the vector field
        $\mathbf{f}{\mathbf{x}(0)}$, approximate the solution at some small time
        step $\Delta t << 1$ in the future. The simplest
        approximation/discretisation we can make is
        $$\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{x}(0)}{\mathrm{d}t} =
        \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}(0)) \quad
        \underset{\mathrm{(discretise)}}{\longrightarrow} \quad
        \frac{\mathbf{x}(\Delta t) - \mathbf{x}(0)}{\Delta t} \approx
        \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}(0))$$ Recall that the definition of the derivative
        at $t=0$ is $\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{x}(0)} {\mathrm{d}t} :=\lim_{\Delta
        t\rightarrow 0}\frac{\mathbf{x}(\Delta t) - \mathbf{x}(0)}{\Delta t}$,
        so the approximation is the same as this but assuming that $\Delta t <<
        1$ is a finite small number instead of taking the limit all the way to
        zero $\Delta t \rightarrow 0$. So the above discretisation is
        interpreted as "the discrete derivative approximates the vector field
        evaluated at $t=0$" (actually we could have chosen any value $0\le t \le
        \Delta t$ but $t=0$ is the simplest). We can now rearrange this equation
        to get the following $$\mathbf{x}_1=\mathbf{x}_0 + \Delta t
        \,\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_0),$$ where we are now using the notation
        $\mathbf{x}_n\approx \mathbf{x}(n\Delta x)$ (except for $n=0$, where the
        $\approx$ is an $=$ as the initial conditions are by definition exact).
        In other words, using the above discretisation we can calculate an
        approximation $\mathbf{x}_1$ to $\mathbf{x}(\Delta t)$. Note that using
        other discretiations we can calculate other approximations
        $\mathbf{x}_1$. Finding better and more sophisticated discretisations is
        basically the whole field of numerical analysis. The particular
        discretisation that lead to the above formula for $\mathbf{x}_1$ is
        called the <em>Forward Euler method</em>. This gives an approximation to
        the exact solution at time $t=\Delta t << 1$. So to find a solution at
        some arbitrary time $t\gt 1$ in the future, we can iteratively apply
        this approximation until we reach the desired time. For example if we
        want the approximation at time $t=2\Delta t$ then we calculate
        $$\mathbf{x}(2\Delta t)\approx\mathbf{x}_2=\mathbf{x}_1 + \Delta t
        \,\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_1),$$ where $\mathbf{x}_1$ is the forward Euler
        approximation starting from $\mathbf{x}_0$ as we wrote above. </p>

<h1>Geometric numerical analysis</h1>
<p style="font-family: Arial;">
    Solving differential equations allows us to model the behaviour of complex
    physical systems. The usual approach to solving them would be to apply a
    standard numerical method. Standard methods can be thought of as a purely
    mathematical approximations to the solution of the differential equation and
    often bears little resemblance any physical laws that happen to govern the
    dynamics. This is largely due to the fact that the development of numerical
    methods over the past 100 years have been geared towards making them
    <b>generally applicable</b>. Meaning they can be applied to pretty much any
    different equation that we need to solve. This is very powerful feature
    because we can almost blindly apply these methods to any problem and get a
    reasonable and consistent approximation to the exact solution. However, this
    generality comes with a cost. Namely, any physical laws that govern the
    dynamics of the equations under study could be broken. As many differential
    equations that are worth solving arise from some sort of physical law,
    standard methods have limited effectiveness when it comes to approximating
    physically consistent solutions. The idea of a
    <em>geometric</em> numerical method is therefore to combine our
    understanding of standard numerical analysis with our understanding of the
    laws of physics to calculate physically consistent solutions. While this
    takes a bit more effort to design such a specialised method, it will lead to
    numerical solutions that are both quantitatively accurate as well as
    <em>qualitatively</em> correct. Due to this, the computing power required
    from geometric methods can often be far less than that of a standard method,
    meaning we can simulate larger problems for less computational cost.

    <!-- <b><em>Geometric</em> numerical analysis: </b> The above forward
    Euler method can be thought of as a purely mathematical
    approximation to the differential equation that we are solving,
    bearing no relevance to the real world. This is due to the fact that
    the forward Euler method is a general purpose method. Meaning that
    is can be applied to pretty much any different equation that we are
    given. This is very powerful, as we can apply this method to a
    differential equation and we can get a reasonable approximation that
    is numerically consistent. However, this generality comes with a
    cost. Namely, any physical laws that govern the dynamics of the
    equations under study could be broken. This is usually a very bad
    thing as most equations that are worth solving arise from some sort
    of physical law. One of the most common laws is the law of
    conservation of energy. In classical mechanics, this is the
    statement that in a dynamical system, the total energy remains
    constant in time, that is $$\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = 0.$$
    For our harmonic oscillator, this corresponds to the total energy
    $$E(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{2}v^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^2,$$ due to the fact
    that a spring has a quadratic potential. We can see that the exact
    solutions preserve this energy due to the fact that
    $\cos(t)^2+\sin(t)^2=1$ (this is Pythagoras' theorem) is constant in
    time. We would also like our numerical approximation $\mathbf{x}_1$
    to satisfy energy conservation $$\frac{E(\mathbf{x}_1) -
    E(\mathbf{x}_0)}{\Delta t} = 0$$ or simply
    $E(\mathbf{x}_1)=E(\mathbf{x}_0)$. That is, we would like the energy
    after one time step to be equal to the energy at the previous time
    step. -->

    Take an oscillating weight of mass $m$ on a frictionless spring with spring
    constant $k$ in zero gravity (A.K.A. a simple harmonic oscillator). The
    force of a spring is $F=-kx$, where $x$ is the displacement (or amplitude)
    from the spring's resting position. Then Newton's second law of motion is
    $$m\frac{\mathrm{d}^2x}{\mathrm{d}t^2} =-kx.$$ For simplicity, let's set
    $m=k=1$ and call $y=\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} $ the velocity. The we
    can rearrange the equation to $$\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} = y, \quad
    \frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}t} = -x,$$ with initial conditions $$ x(0)=x_0,
    \quad y(0)=y_0.$$ Having initial conditions means that we know the starting
    position and velocity at time $t=0$, that is, they are the known constants
    $x_0$ and $y_0$. For example $x_0=1$, $y_0=0$ means that at time $t=0$ we
    drop the mass with amplitude 1 from rest as shown in the below gifs.
</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial;">
    The simple harmonic oscillator corresponds to the vector field
    $\mathbf{f}=(y,-x)^T$ which is plotted below. (Recall that a
    vector/vector-field is simply a way of assigning a vector to every point on
    the $x$-$y$ plane)

    The solution to the differential equation is a line parametrised by time
    $t$, that travels in the direction of the vector field $\mathbf{f}$ (in
    other words, $\mathbf{f}$ is the tangent vector of the line). By looking at
    the above graph you can see that such a line would be a circle. As expected,
    the <em>exact</em> solution to this differnetial equation is $$x(t) =
    \sin(t), \quad y(t) = \cos(t)$$ which is the equation for a circle. Note
    that we have ignored some constants to avoid cluttering the equations.

    Now say that we didn't actually know how to calculate the exact solution.
    The option we have available then is to then approximate the solution using,
    for example, a numerical method. At this point we could apply a standard
    method to the problem, which would result in the below solution (the red
    line). We can see that the line travels in <em>almost</em> the direction of
    the vector field, but tends to spiral outwards.

<p style="font-family: Arial;">
    At first glance this might not seem like such a bad thing, but let's now
    look at the physics behind this differential equation to see what the
    consequence of using a standard method is. One of the physcial laws that
    govern the dynamics of the oscillator is the <em>conservation of
    energy</em>. The total energy of the system is the sum of kinetic and
    potential energy: $$E = \frac{1}{2}y^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^2.$$ This law tells us
    that energy stays constant in time, meaning its time derivative is zero:
    using the chain rule, $$\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} =
    \frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}t} y + \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} x = -xy
    + yx = 0. $$ Moreover, $2E=x^2+y^2$ is the equation for a circle with radius
    $\sqrt{2E}$ and that the exact solution satisfies $\cos(t)^2+\sin(t)^2=1$
    (this is the trigonometric version of Pythagoras' theorem). Below is a
    contour plot of the total energy.
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="figs/energy.png" alt="level sets energy "
        style="float:center;width:300px;height:300px;">
    <figcaption> The contour lines of the total energy $E$.
    </figcaption>
</div>
<br>
<p style="font-family: Arial;">
    In analogy to contour lines on a map that denote paths of equal height on a
    hill, the above contour lines denote the coordintes $(x,y)$ of constant
    energy. The radius of each ring is defined by the initial conditions and the
    larger the radius the greater the energy of the oscillating mass. We
    observed that the standard method spiralled outwards (i.e., it traverses
    circles of larger radius). This is because the errors associated with the
    standard numerical method erroneously injects energy into the system violating
    the conservation of energy.
    <br>
    <br>
    With this knowledge, we can instead choose a numerical method that obeys a
    <em>discrete</em> version of conservation of energy. Applying such a method
    to the differential equation gives teh below numerical solution. 
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">

        style="float:center;width:300px;height:300px;">
    <figcaption> An energy-preserving geometric
        method (the implicit midpoint rule).
    </figcaption>
</div>
<p style="font-family: Arial;">
    It can be seen (and proven mathematically) that the numerical solution of
    the above geometric method traces out a perfect circle, meaning that the
    energy remains exactly constant. This means that we can trust that our
    numerical solution is, despite still having errors, is going to be
    physically correct. This almost always yields better solutions comapared to
    standard methods of equal computational cost.
    <br>
    <br>
    To summarise, if you have extra knowledge of your differential equation, you
    should exploit it when designing numerical mehtods to get better solutions.
