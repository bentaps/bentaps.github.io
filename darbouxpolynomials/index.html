This page introduces the concept of Darboux polynomials (also known as weak
integrals, second integrals, eigen functions, algebraic invariant curves, etc.).
Darboux polynomials are the basis for the main results of this paper (<a
href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.10929.pdf">open access version</a>). This paper
gives novel results about Runge-Kutta methods and <em>discrete Darboux polynomials</em>
(which is a concept introduced in 
<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1751-8121/ab294b/pdf">this paper</a>
and <a href="https://www.aimsciences.org/article/doi/10.3934/jcd.2022014">this
paper</a>). Discrete Darboux polynomials are presented at the end of this page
along with a summary of the results of the main paper. We will start with an
intuitive example.

<h2>Example: predator-prey model</h2>

<p style="font-family: Arial">
    Consider a set of coupled differential equations for a predator-prey system.
    Say that $x$ models the population of a prey species (e.g., rabbits), and
    $y$ models the population of a predator species (e.g., foxes) $$ \dot{x} =
    {x}(1-y),\quad \dot{y} = y(x-1). $$ We can see here that the population of
    rabbits will decrease (in other words, $\dot{x} < 0$) when there are many
    foxes eating them ($y>1$), and the population increases ($\dot{x}>0$) when
    there are few foxes ($y < 1$) hindering their birth rate. Similarly, the fox
    population will dwindle ($\dot{y} < 0$) when there are too few rabbits to
    eat ($x< 1$) and will increase ($\dot{y} > 0$) when there is an abundance of
    rabbits ($x>1$). Let's examine some qualitative features of this
    differential equation by looking at some examples of its solutions. Note
    that this equation only <em>physically</em> makes sense for positive values
    of $x$ and $y$ as you can't have negative rabbits or foxes, however we will
    allow negative values for illustration purposes. The following animation
    plots solutions to this differential equation as blue lines  starting from
    random initial conditions (black dots).

</div>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
    We can see a number of things happening here from these solutions:
</p>
<ul style="font-family: Arial">
    <li>Solutions on the left hand side seem to converge to the x-axis.</li>
    <li>Solutions on the bottom right seem to go off to infinity.</li>
    <li>Solutions on the top right are bounded, and form closed loops.</li>
    <li>Solutions never cross the $x$- or $y$-axes, that is if they begin
        positive (or negative) they stay positive (or negative). </li>
    <li>Solutions that begin on $x$- or $y$-axes stay on the $x$- or
        $y$-axes (i.e., if you have 0 rabbits or foxes then they stay 0 as they
        can't magically appear). </li>
</ul>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
    All of these observations are no coincidence and can be explained in
    terms of <em>Darboux polynomials</em>.
</p>
<h2>Darboux polynomials: </h2>

<p style="font-family: Arial">
    Say we have a 2-dimensional set of ordinary differential equations for the
    dependent variables $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ $$\dot{x}=f(x, y),\quad \dot{y}= g(x,
    y),$$ where the dot denotes a time derivative $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}
    t}$ and $x=x(t)$ and $y=y(t)$ are functions of $t$ but we just write $x$ and
    $y$ for brevity. This differential equation can possess something called a
    <em>Darboux polynomial</em> $p(x,y)$ if there exists a function $a(x,y)$
    called the <em>cofactor</em> satisfying the following eigenfunction equation
    $$\dot{p}(x,y) = a(x,y)p(x,y).$$ Note here the time derivative is actually a
    <em> directional derivative</em> along the flow of the differential
    equation's vector field $\mathbf{f}=(f(x,y),g(x,y))^T$, requiring use of the
    chain rule. <!--That is, $$\dot{p}(x,y) = f(x,y)\frac{\partial
    p(x,y)}{\partial x} + g(x,y)\frac{\partial p(x,y)}{\partial y} =
    (\mathbf{f}\cdot\nabla)p(x,y).$$ -->
    <!-- <p
style="color: black; border:dotted; font-family: Arial; margin-left:20px; margin-right:20px"> -->
    Darboux Polynomials are also called <em>
        eigenfunctions</em> as they are analogous to <em> eigenvectors
    </em> for matrices. Recall that a square matrix $A$ has an eigenvector
    $\mathbf{v}$ if there exists a scalar eigenvalue $\lambda$ satisfying the
    equation $A\mathbf{v}=\lambda\mathbf{v}$ then we recover the above equation
    by exchanging $A\rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}$,
    $\mathbf{v}\rightarrow p(x, y)$ and $\lambda\rightarrow a(x,y)$. In other
    words, differentiation of $p(x,y)$ is equivalent to multiplication of a
    scalar function.
    <br>
    <br>
    Darboux Polynomials also go by the name <em>second integrals</em>
    (or
    <em>weak integrals</em>). Recall that a <em>first integral</em> (or
    <em>strong integral</em>) is a function $H(x,y)$ that is left
    constant/invariant along the solution of the differential equation, that is,
    $\dot{H}(x, y)=0$. In constast, Darboux polynomials are only constant along
    solutions of the differential equation from initial conditions that satisfy
    $p(x_0, y_0)=0$. That is, from certain initial conditions they behave like
    first integrals. Due to this, the solution of a differential equation cannot
    cross regions where $p(x,y)=0$. In other words, these regions act as
    barriers and partition the solution space into regions that are
    qualitatively different. For example, say that we have a predator-prey
    system that models the population of two competing species in an
    environment. Then we necessarily require that both values remain positive as
    you can't have a negative number of a species, and if one value becomes
    zero, then it must stay zero as a species cannot come from nothing. You
    should be able to observe this behaviour in the animations on this page.

        Finding first-integrals from Darboux polynomials
    </summary>

    <!--  CONTENT GOES HERE-->
    An interesting property about Darboux polynomials is that products of
    Darboux polynomials are also Darboux polynomials. That is if we have two
    Darboux polynomials $p(x,y)$ and $q(x,y)$ of a given differential equation
    that satisfy $\dot{p}(x,y)=a(x,y)p(x,y)$ and $\dot{q}(x,y)=b(x,y)q(x,y)$,
    then the product $p(x,y)^\alpha q(x,y)^\beta$ is also a Darboux polynomial
    with cofactor $\alpha a(x,y)+\beta b(x,y)$. That is,
    $$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left(p(x,y)^\alpha
    q(x,y)^\beta\right)=(\alpha a(x,y)+\beta b(x,y))p(x,y)^\alpha
    q(x,y)^\beta.$$ So in the special case where $\alpha a(x,y)+\beta b(x,y)=0$
    then $p(x,y)^\alpha q(x,y)^\beta$ is actually a first integral (AKA
    invariant, strong integral, preserved quantity). For example, if there exist
    two Darboux polynomials, say $p(x,y)$ and $q(x,y)$, with the same cofactor
    $c(x,y)$ then their ratio is a first integral, that is
    $$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\frac{p(x,y)}{q(x,y)}=0$$ Note that finding
    Darboux polynomials is a difficult task and there do not exist too many
    computationally tractable methods for doing so.

<h2>Back to the predator-prey system:</h2>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
    If we look back to the differential equation we presented earlier we see
    that it possesses the following two Darboux polynomials $$p(x,y) = x, \quad
    q(x,y) = y$$ corresponding to the cofactors $$a(x,y) = 1-y, \quad b(x,y) = x
    - 1,$$ respectively. We can now plot the two lines $p(x,y)=0,\quad
    q(x,y)=0$, which corresponds to $x=0$ and $y=0$. In the following animation,
    these are plotted as dashed black lines. Finally the differential equation's
    vector field is plotted on top.

        style="width:400px;height:400px;" class="center" />
</div>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
    Again, we notice that no solution crosses the dashed black lines, and all
    the solutions that start on the dashed black line remain on that line (that
    is, the Darboux polynomials behave like first integrals when the initial
    conditions satisfy $p(x_0,y_0)=0$) and so forth.

<h2>Super fun game: Can you spot the Darboux polynomials?</h2>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
    Here is a differential equation with three Darboux polynomials
    $$\dot{x}={x}^{2}+2\,xy+3\,{y}^{2},\quad \dot{y}=2\,y \left( 2\,x+y
    \right).$$ There is one Darboux polynomial that can be seen from the above
    equation, and the other two can be seen by looking at the below animation.

        The following are the three Darboux polynomials: $$p(x,y) = x + y, \quad
        q(x,y) = x - y, \quad r(x,y) = y,$$ corresponding to the cofactors
        $$a(x,y) = x + 5y, \quad b(x,y) = x - y, \quad c(x,y) = 4x+2y,$$
        respectively. Note $r(x,y) = y$ is the simplest Darboux polynomial to
        see just by looking at the differential equation. We can now plot the
        three lines $p(x,y)=q(x,y)=r(x,y)=0$, which gives us the three linear
        equations $y=x$, $y=-x$ and $y=0$. These are plotted as dashed black
        lines. Finally the differential equation's vector field is plotted on
        top.

    <b>Numerical (Runge-Kutta) methods:</b> As most differential equations are
    impossible to solve by hand we often seek to approximate them on a computer.
    One of the most popular classes of numerical methods for solving
    differential equations are the Runge-Kutta methods. The most simple example
    of a Runge-Kutta method is the Forward Euler method. We start with an
    arbitrary ordinary differential equation
    $$\dot{\mathbf{x}}=\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}).$$ Here we use bold font to denote
    vector-valued quantities such that our equations also apply to
    multi-dimensional cases (for the previous 2-dimensional case this would be
    $\mathbf{x}(t)=(x(t),y(t))^T$, $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})=(f(x,y),g(x,y))^T$
    and so on). Given the initial conditions $\mathbf{x}(0)=\mathbf{x}_0$ and a
    small time-step $\Delta t$ then the Forward Euler approximation the exact
    solution at time $t=\Delta t$ is denoted by $\mathbf{x}_{\Delta
    t}\approx\mathbf{x}({\Delta t})$ and is given by the formula
    $$\mathbf{x}_{\Delta t} = \mathbf{x}_0 + \Delta t\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_0).$$
    In the following, we will let $\mathbf{x}_{\Delta t}$ denote any
    approximation to the exact solution $\mathbf{x}(\Delta t)$ by any
    Runge-Kutta method. But we can keep the aforementioned, simple example of
    the Forward Euler method in our minds.

<h2><em>Discrete</em> Darboux polynomials</h2>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
    The theory of discrete Darboux polynomials was only recently developed. The
    idea is to take the eigenfunction equation and discretise the time
    derivative like so $$\frac{\mathrm{d}p(\mathbf{x})}{\mathrm{d}t} =
    c(\mathbf{x}) p(\mathbf{x})
    \underset{\mathrm{(discretise)}}{\longrightarrow} \frac{p(\mathbf{x}_{\Delta
    t}) - p(\mathbf{x}_0)}{\Delta t}\approx c(\mathbf{x}_0)p(\mathbf{x}_0)$$
    Rearranging the equation gives $$p(\mathbf{x}_{\Delta
    t})\approx\underbrace{\left(1 + \Delta t
    c(\mathbf{x}_0)\right)}_{\approx{c}_{\Delta
    t}(\mathbf{x}_0)}p(\mathbf{x}_0)$$ in other words, the discrete analogue of
    the eigenfunction equation is given by $$p(\mathbf{x}_{\Delta
    t})={c}_{\Delta t}(\mathbf{x}_0)p(\mathbf{x}_0)$$ where we have introduced
    the
    <em>discrete cofactor</em> ${c}_{\Delta t}(\mathbf{x}_0)$. Now we can
    provide a definition; a numerical method $\mathbf{x}_{\Delta t}$ is said to
    possess a discrete Darboux polynomial $p(\mathbf{x})$ if there exists a
    discrete cofactor $c_{\Delta t}(\mathbf{x}_0)$ that satisfies the above
    discrete eigenfunction equation.

        Finding first-integrals from <em>discrete</em> Darboux polynomials
    </summary>

    <!--  CONTENT GOES HERE-->

    We also have a number of discrete analogues of the continuous Darboux
    polynomial properties. For example we have that if $c_{\Delta
    t}(\mathbf{x})=1$ then $p(\mathbf{x})$ is a first integral (i.e.,
    $p(\mathbf{x}_{\Delta t})=p(\mathbf{x}_{0})$ is kept constant along the
    numerical solution). Furthermore, if $p(\mathbf{x})$ and $q(\mathbf{x})$ are
    both discrete Darboux polynomials of the numerical method, then the product
    $p(\mathbf{x})^\alpha q(\mathbf{x})^\beta$ is a Darboux polynomial with
    cofactor $a(\mathbf{x}_0)^\alpha b(\mathbf{x}_0)^\beta$ (i.e., the
    <em>product</em> of the cofactors is a cofactor, whereas in the continuous
    case it was their sum). That is $$p(\mathbf{x}_{\Delta t})^\alpha
    q(\mathbf{x}_{\Delta t})^\beta =\left( a(\mathbf{x}_0)^\alpha
    b(\mathbf{x}_0)^\beta\right) \left(p(\mathbf{x}_0)^\alpha
    q(\mathbf{x}_0)^\beta\right).$$

<h2>Main results:</h2>
<p style="font-family: Arial;">
    In case you still haven't had enough, here are some of the main results of the paper
    I wrote (up until now has been common knowledge).
    <br><br>
    We answer the following. <b>If a differential equation has a Darboux
    polynomial $p(\mathbf{x})$, will a numerical method have $p(\mathbf{x})$ as
    a discrete Darboux polynomial?</b><br><br>
    We proved that when $p(\mathbf{x})$ is linear then all numerical
    (Runge-Kutta) methods will share the same discrete Darboux polynomials of
    the different equation. However, no numerical (Runge-Kutta) method can
    possess the discrete Darboux polynomial $p(\mathbf{x})$ when it is a
    quadratic (or higher degree) polynomial.
    <br><br>
    A number of interesting and general results about Runge-Kutta methods can be
    inferred from this discovery, the most striking of which is the following.
    <b>If a differential equation possesses a rational first integral of the
    form $H(\mathbf{x})=p(\mathbf{x})/q(\mathbf{x})$ that is linear in the
    numerator and the denominator, then <em>any</em> Runge-Kutta method will
    also also have $H(\mathbf{x})$ as first integral.</b>
    <br><br>
    The fact that we can learn something new about Runge-Kutta methods shows us
    that discrete Darboux polynomials are a worthwhile topic to study further!
